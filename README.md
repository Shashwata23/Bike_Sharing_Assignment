## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
A US based Bike sharing company BoomBikes wants to improve their sales after the covid pandemic. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The company wants to understand the factors (predictor variables) that influence the number of customers in a day so that they can devise a strategy to better cater to the needs of their customers.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Bookbikes has provided a dataset comprising of the number of customers on a day, the month and season, the type of day (holiday, weekday etc.) and also the weather condition (temperature, humidity, cloud cover, rainfall etc.).

## Conclusions
- A multiple linear regression model has been developed, in which the major factors (having highest magnitude of the coefficient) are found to be the temperature, year and the snow_or_rain weather condition.
